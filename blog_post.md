A fundamental challenge in **meteorological and oceanographic (met/ocean) forecasting** is the efficient distribution of forecast model results. Standard forecast models typically have a forecast duration that is longer than the time between forecasts (e.g., a 3-day forecast run every day), creating a collection of files with **overlapping time coordinates**. End-users, however, almost always want a **continuous time series** (e.g., a "best time series") to compare with observational data.

Historically, data providers addressed this by:

  * Creating new, consolidated "best time series" datasets by cutting and merging segments from the individual forecast runs.
  * Utilizing data services like **[THREDDS](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/thredds-user-guide)** to create virtual Forecast Model Run Collection (FMRC) datasets, offering views like "best time series" or "constant forecast offset."

### The Modern Cloud-Native Approach

For **cloud-native workflows**, a more scalable, flexible, and robust approach is now available. This modern strategy leverages specialized tools to construct virtual data views dynamically:

1.  **[Virtualizarr](https://virtualizarr.readthedocs.io/)** is used to create virtual references (metadata) for the model output files.
2.  These references are indexed into an **[Icechunk repository](https://github.com/earth-mover/icechunk)**.
3.  **[Rolodex](https://xarray-indexes.readthedocs.io/earth/forecast.html)** then uses **Xarray's advanced indexing capabilities** to construct the required views (like the "best time series") on the fly, providing immediate access to continuous data streams.

This exact pipeline has recently been implemented to support the **[CoastPredict](https://www.coastpredict.org/)/[GlobalCoast](https://www.coastpredict.org/globalcoast-initiative/)/[Protocoast](https://www.coastpredict.org/protocoast-cloud/)** project.

## 🌍 The GlobalCoast and ProtoCoast Initiatives

**CoastPredict** is a Programme endorsed under the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development, focused on revolutionizing Global Coastal Ocean observation and forecasting.

**GlobalCoast** is a European-led endorsed action under the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. It provides the framework for establishing a seamless, integrated, and sustained **global coastal ocean observing and forecasting system**. This system aims to improve the understanding of coastal processes, enhance the prediction of coastal hazards, and deliver essential information for the sustainable management of coastal resources, addressing critical issues like sea-level rise and marine pollution.

### ProtoCoast: Enabling Cloud-Native Workflows

To standardize computation and accelerate progress, **ProtoCoast** is a key GlobalCoast initiative focused on enabling **cloud-native workflows** for model execution, data accessibility (both observational and model output), and the creation of shared research environments.

ProtoCoast utilizes the **[EGI Cloud Infrastructure](https://www.egi.eu/)**. Initial workflow testing has been conducted on the **[Pangeo@EOSC JupyterHub](https://pangeo-eosc.vm.fedcloud.eu/)**, which runs on EGI infrastructure in the Czech Republic.

## ⛵️ Pilot Site Example: Gulf of Taranto

ProtoCoast features several pilot sites producing both forecast model output and near-real-time sensor data. The **Gulf of Taranto** pilot site provides an excellent example. It features:

  * **Near-Real Time Data:** Telemetered water level sensor data.
  * **Model Output:** The **SHYFEM coastal ocean model** runs daily, producing a 6-day forecast stored in a **NetCDF3 file**.

-----

### Step 1: Rechunking and Cloud Ingestion

The initial step in the cloud-native data pipeline is preparing the model output for efficient cloud access.

  * The two NetCDF3 files produced by SHYFEM are **reformatted and rechunked** on the High-Performance Computing (HPC) system where the model runs.
  * The **[NCO (NetCDF Operators)](https://nco.sourceforge.net/)** tool is used for this process, converting the data to NetCDF4. This choice retains the NetCDF format to support existing legacy applications while making the chunk size and shape more appropriate for cloud-based use (another choice would have been converting to Zarr format).

The NCO rechunking command specifies the new chunk sizes:

```bash
ncks -4 -L 5 -O -d time,0,143 --cnk_dmn=time,72 --cnk_dmn=node,16000 --cnk_dmn=level,1 --cnk_plc=all taranto_nos.nc taranto_nos_20251205_nc4.nc
```

This configuration results in approximately **4MB chunks** for both 2D (like elevation) and 3D (like temperature) variables. These rechunked, cloud-ready files are then pushed to an **S3-compatible (MinIO) bucket** on the EGI Cloud infrastructure.

-----

### Step 2: Virtualization and Indexing with Virtualizarr, Icechunk, and Rolodex

Once the files are in the cloud, a Python script then runs on the HPC system that performs:

1.  **Creating Virtual References:** Virtualizarr generates references to the rechunked NetCDF4 data.
2.  **FMRC Convention Formatting:** The single `time` coordinate (hourly steps) in the raw NetCDF files is converted to the Forecast Model Run Collection (FMRC) convention required by Rolodex, resulting in two new coordinate variables: `time` (the analysis time, with a single value) and `step` (the forecast period offsets, with 144 values).
3.  **Appending to Icechunk:** The references are then appended to a virtual Icechunk repository along the new `valid_time` dimension.

The code looks like this:

```python
ds_list = [
    open_virtual_dataset(
        url=url,
        parser=parser,
        registry=registry,
        loadable_variables=["time"],
    )
    for url in flist[-1:]
]

def fix_ds(ds):
    ds = ds.rename_vars(time='valid_time')
    ds = ds.rename_dims(time='step')
    step = (ds.valid_time - ds.valid_time[0]).assign_attrs({"standard_name": "forecast_period"})
    time = ds.valid_time[0].assign_attrs({"standard_name": "forecast_reference_time"})
    ds = ds.assign_coords(step=step, time=time)
    ds = ds.drop_indexes("valid_time")
    ds = ds.drop_vars('valid_time')
    ds = ds.set_coords(['latitude', 'longitude', 'element_index', 'topology', 'total_depth'])
    return ds

ds_list = [fix_ds(ds) for ds in ds_list]

combined_nos = xr.concat(
    ds_list,
    dim="time",
    coords="minimal",
    compat="override",
    combine_attrs="override",
)
```

The resulting 2D and 3D model outputs are merged and appended to the Icechunk repository:

```python
ds = xr.merge([combined_nos, combined_ous], compat='override')
ds.virtualize.to_icechunk(append_session.store, append_dim="time")
```

A full notebook version of this script is [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/OpenScienceComputing/cloud-school-2025/blob/main/taranto-icechunk-append.ipynb).

The resulting virtual dataset in Xarray, now structured for FMRC indexing, appears as:

### Dynamic Views with Rolodex

Finally, **Rolodex** is used to extract a **"best time series"** view dynamically.  For example, here a constant forecast offset (e.g., 2 hours after the analysis time) is selected for construction of the continuous series using the Rolodex "BestEstimate" method:

```python
import rolodex.forecast
from rolodex.forecast import (
    BestEstimate,
    ForecastIndex,
)

ds.coords["valid_time"] = rolodex.forecast.create_lazy_valid_time_variable(
    reference_time=ds.time, period=ds.step
)

newds = ds.drop_indexes(["time", "step"]).set_xindex(
    ["time", "step", "valid_time"], ForecastIndex)

ds_best = newds.sel(valid_time=BestEstimate(offset=2))  # start at forecast hour 2 instead of 0
```

This produces a virtual dataset with a continuous time variable:

This cloud-native pipeline allows for rapid extraction and plotting of time series data at a specific location, taking less than 3 seconds for the operation.

## 💡 Conclusion

The implementation of this pipeline for the **GlobalCoast/Protocoast** project successfully demonstrates a highly scalable and resilient approach to distributing collections of met/ocean forecast data. By using a **cloud-native virtualization strategy** leveraging **Virtualizarr, Icechunk, and Rolodex**, we have enabled **on-the-fly FMRC views** like the "best time series." This modern architecture ensures that end-users, whether running analysis or supporting critical coastal management decisions, have immediate, performant access to the continuous, authoritative data they require, while at the same time streamlining the data provider's workflow.
